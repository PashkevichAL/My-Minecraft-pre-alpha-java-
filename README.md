# Beginings
Simple project, what arose because of an argument with my frieds, who dont belive, i can do it from scratch.
This is not a guide. Just a path of a newbie in programing.

First of all:
1. Learn the basics of programming on java.
2. Get basics knowledge of gamedev.
3. Create a pre-classic version.

After completing this tasks I will start move gradually to working on the pre-alpha version.
